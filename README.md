## Project Description
This project is a simple UI pattern project that uses HTML and CSS and JS to create a simple website using the Fetch() and .then methods to retrieve data from an API. The API used is the Simpsons Quotes API. The project is a simple website that displays a random quote from the API and the character that said it. The user can click the sides arrows to get a new quote and character.
